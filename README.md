# Algorithms & Data Structures
Welcome to the Algorithms and Data Structures repository! Here you'll find a collection of popular algorithms and data structures built from scratch in C++ and Java. The purpose of this repository is to learn how to **think like a computer scientist**, and to do this I needed to understand the fundamental concepts of programming. What better way to learn then to build them yourself!

# Building and Running the C++ programs
To build the the different assignments within the C++ folder simply:

1. navigate into the assignment directory of your choice using the **"cd"** command
2. Luckily I made you a makefile, therefore, to build the program execute the following command: **"make"**
3. Once the program is built successfully, execute it using: **"./programx"**. Replace x with the number of the assignment directory you are in.
